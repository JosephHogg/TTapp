            <strong>
                <em>What is the ladder?</em>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The ladder is a casual ongoing tournament that takes place during the Monday and Tuesday club sessions. If you want to be a part of the ladder the cost of joining is

            <strong>&pound;2</strong>.

        </p>
        <p>The initial order of players on the ladder will be decided by drawing names out of a hat. If you decide to join the ladder after this you will be placed at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The ladder is just for  fun and is open to all club members regardless of their standard. Therefore we encourage any member to take part. Yes, that includes you! Go on. You've got nothing to lose.*</p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>How to play</em>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Once you've joined the ladder you are added to the list of players. It is your goal to try and reach the top of this list. This is achieved by making  'challenges' with members who are in places above you.</p>
        <p>When  you challenge someone, you and the challenged  player will play a  table tennis match. This match will be best of 3 games up to 11 points. If the challenger wins the match then the they will take the loser's position, with the loser and all intermediate players moving down one place. If the challenger loses the match the positions remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>Note that if a player refuses a valid challenge, then it will be counted as a loss for that player. Therefore, try to accept all challenges if you want to defend your position!</p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>Making challenges</em>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p> Challenges can be made at any club session (Monday, Tuesday and Friday) and not within the last 10 minutes unless agreed on by both parties.

            <br />
            <br />
            You can only play the same person once in a session, regardless of who is challenging and who has been challenged.

        </p>
        <p>You can only challenge a player if they are within a given number of positions above you: </p>

        <p>If none of these people are present, talk to a member of the Exec and you might be able to challenge someone else.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>Recording matches</em>
            </strong>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p> You must report the result of your ladder match to one of the Exec members who will note your result and change the positions accordingly. Even if the challenger loses please report the game to one of the exec so you don't get moved to the bottom.

            <br />
            <br />
            If any player does not report a played match to the exec in 4 consecutive sessions they will be moved to the bottom of the ladder. This is done to avoid a member taking one of the top positions and then  not being present at sessions for that position to be challenged.

        <p> If there's something you haven't understood with regards to match rules or ladder rules feel free to ask an Exec member. We will have a copy of the rules and ladder at the sessions.</p>
        <p>The current positions on the ladder will also be displayed on this website. This may or may not be up to date depending on how often the webmaster (that's me!) is able to update it.

            <br />
        </p>
        <p>Also, there will be prizes for those who reach the top positions in the ladder!</p>
